Jill ought to have been back at the white rock already but she had quite forgotten that part of her orders the excitement of watching the fight .
Now she remembered .
She turned at once and ran to it , and arrived there barely a second before the others .
It thus happened that all of them , for a moment , had their backs to the enemy .
They all wheeled round the moment they had reached it .
A terrible sight met their eyes .
A Calormene was running towards the Stable door carrying something that kicked and struggled .
As he came between them and the fire they could see clearly both the shape of the man and the shape of what he carried .
It was Eustace .
Tirian and the Unicorn rushed out to rescue him .
But the Calormene was now far nearer to the door than they .
Before they had covered half the distance he had flung Eustace in and shut the door on him .
Half a dozen more Calormenes had run up behind him .
They formed line on the open space before the Stable .
There was no getting at it now .
Even then Jill remembered to keep her face turned aside , well away from her bow .
" Even if I ca n't stop blubbing , I _won't_ get my string wet , " she said .
" ' Ware arrows , " said Poggin suddenly .
Everyone ducked and pulled his helmet well over his nose .
The Dogs crouched behind .
But though a few arrows came their way , it soon became clear that they were not being shot at .
Griffle and his Dwarfs were at their archery again .
This time they were coolly shooting at the Calormenes .
" Keep it up , boys ! " came Griffle 's voice .
" All together .
Carefully .
We do n't want Darkies any more than we want Monkeys -- or Lions -- or Kings .
The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs . "
Whatever else you may say about Dwarfs , no one can say they are n't brave .
They could easily have got away to some safe place .
They preferred to stay and kill as many of both sides as they could , except when both sides were kind enough to save them trouble by killing one another .
They wanted Narnia for their own .
What perhaps they had not taken into account was that the Calormenes were mailclad and the Horses had had no protection .
Also the Calormenes had a leader .
Rishda Tarkaan 's voice cried out :
" Thirty of you keep watch on those fools by the white rock .
The rest , after me , that we may teach these sons of earth a lesson . "
Tirian and his friends , still panting from their fight and thankful for a few minutes ' rest , stood and looked on while the Tarkaan led his men against the Dwarfs .
It was a strange scene by now .
The fire had sunk lower : the light it gave was now less and of a darker red .
As far as one could see , the whole place of assembly was now empty except for the Dwarfs and the Calormenes .
In that light one could n't make out much of what was happening .
It sounded as if the Dwarfs were putting up a good fight .
Tirian could hear Griffle using dreadful language , and every now and then the Tarkaan calling " Take all you can alive !
Take them alive ! "
Whatever that fight may have been like , it did not last long .
The noises of it died away .
Then Jill saw the Tarkaan coming back to the stable : eleven men followed him , dragging eleven bound Dwarfs .
( Whether the others had all been killed , or whether some of them had got away , was never known . )
" Throw them into the shrine of Tash , " said Rishda Tarkaan .
And when the eleven Dwarfs , one after the other , had been flung or kicked into that dark doorway and the door had been shut again , he bowed low to the Stable and said :
" These also are for thy burnt offering , Lord Tash . "
And all the Calormenes banged the flats of their swords on their shields and shouted , " Tash !
Tash !
The great god Tash !
Inexorable Tash ! "
( There was no nonsense about " Tashlan " now . )
The little party by the white rock watched these doings and whispered to one another .
They had found a trickle of water coming down the rock and all had drunk eagerly -- Jill and Poggin and the King in their hands , while the four - footed ones lapped from the little pool which it had made at the foot of the stone .
Such was their thirst that it seemed the most delicious drink they had ever had in their lives , and while they were drinking they were perfectly happy and could not think of anything else .
" I feel in my bones , " said Poggin , " that we shall all , one by one , pass through that dark door before morning .
I can think of a hundred deaths I would rather have died . "
" It is indeed a grim door , " said Tirian .
" It is more like a mouth . "
" Oh , ca n't we do _anything_ to stop it ? " said Jill in a shaken voice .
" Nay , fair friend , " said Jewel , nosing her gently .
" It may be for us the door to Aslan 's country and we shall sup at his table tonight . "
Rishda Tarkaan turned his back on the Stable and walked slowly to a place in front of the white rock .
" Hearken , " he said .
" If the Boar and the Dogs and the Unicorn will come over to me and put themselves in my mercy , their lives shall be spared .
The Boar shall go to a cage in the Tisroc 's garden , the Dogs to the Tisroc 's kennels , and the Unicorn , when I have sawn his horn off , shall draw a cart .
But the Eagle , the children , and he who was the King shall be offered to Tash this night . "
The only answer was growls .
" Get on , warriors , " said the Tarkaan .
" Kill the beasts , but take the two - legged ones alive . "
And then the last battle of the last King of Narnia began .
What made it hopeless , even apart from the numbers of the enemy , was the spears .
The Calormenes who had been with the Ape almost from the beginning had had no spears : that was because they had come into Narnia by ones and twos , pretending to be peaceful merchants , and of course they had carried no spears for a spear is not a thing you can hide .
The new ones must have come in later , after the Ape was already strong and they could march openly .
The spears made all the difference .
With a long spear you can kill a boar before you are in reach of his tusks and a unicorn before you are in reach of his horn ; if you are very quick and keep your head .
And now the levelled spears were closing in on Tirian and his last friends .
Next minute they were all fighting for their lives .
In a way it was n't quite so bad as you might think .
When you are using every muscle to the full -- ducking under a spear - point here , leaping over it there , lunging forward , drawing back , wheeling round -- you have n't much time to feel either frightened or sad .
Tirian knew he could do nothing for the others now ; they were all doomed together .
He vaguely saw the Boar go down on one side of him , and Jewel fighting furiously on the other .
Out of the corner of one eye he saw , but only just saw , a big Calormene pulling Jill away somewhere by her hair .
But he hardly thought about any of these things .
His only thought now was to sell his life as dearly as he could .
The worst of it was that he could n't keep to the position in which he had started , under the white rock .
A man who is fighting a dozen enemies at once must take his chances wherever he can ; must dart in wherever he sees an enemy 's breast or neck unguarded .
In a very few strokes this may get you quite a distance from the spot where you began .
Tirian soon found that he was getting further and further to the right , nearer to the Stable .
He had a vague idea in his mind that there was some good reason for keeping away from it .
But he could n't now remember what the reason was .
And anyway , he could n't help it .
All at once everything came quite clear .
He found he was fighting the Tarkaan himself .
The bonfire ( what was left of it ) was straight in front .
He was in fact fighting in the very doorway of the Stable , for it had been opened and two Calormenes were holding the door , ready to slam it shut the moment he was inside .
He remembered everything now , and he realised that the enemy had been edging him to the Stable on purpose ever since the fight began .
And while he was thinking this , he was still fighting the Tarkaan as hard as he could .
A new idea came into Tirian 's head .
He dropped his sword , darted forward , in under the sweep of the Tarkaan 's scimitar , seized his enemy by the belt with both hands , and jumped back into the Stable , shouting :
" Come in and meet Tash yourself ! "
There was a deafening noise .
As when the Ape had been flung in , the earth shook and there was a blinding light .
The Calormene soldiers outside screamed , " Tash , Tash ! " and banged the door .
If Tash wanted their own Captain , Tash must have him .
They , at any rate , did not want to meet Tash .
For a moment or two Tirian did not know where he was or even who he was .
Then he steadied himself , blinked , and looked around .
It was not dark inside the Stable , as he had expected .
He was in strong light : that was why he was blinking .
He turned to look at Rishda Tarkaan , but Rishda was not looking at him .
Rishda gave a great wail and pointed ; then he put his hands before his face and fell flat , face downwards on the ground .
Tirian looked in the direction where the Tarkaan had pointed .
And then he understood .
A terrible figure was coming towards them .
It was far smaller than the shape they had seen from the Tower , though still much bigger than a man , and it was the same .
It had a vulture 's head and four arms .
Its beak was open and its eyes blazed .
A croaking voice came from its beak .
" Thou hast called me into Narnia , Rishda Tarkaan .
Here I am .
What hast thou to say ? "
But the Tarkaan neither lifted his face from the ground nor said a word .
He was shaking like a man with a bad hiccup .
He was brave enough in battle : but half his courage had left him earlier that night when he first began to suspect that there might be a real Tash .
The rest of it had left him now .
With a sudden jerk -- like a hen stooping to pick up a worm -- Tash pounced on the miserable Rishda and tucked him under the upper of his two left arms .
Then Tash turned his head sidewise to fix Tirian with one of his terrible eyes : for of course , having a bird 's head , he could n't look at you straight .
But immediately , from behind Tash , strong and calm as the summer sea , a voice said :
" Begone , Monster , and take your lawful prey to your own place : in the name of Aslan and Aslan 's great Father , the Emperor - over-sea . "
The hideous creature vanished , with the Tarkaan still under its arm .
And Tirian turned to see who had spoken .
And what he saw then set his heart beating as it had never beaten in any fight .
Seven Kings and Queens stood before him , all with crowns on their heads and all in glittering clothes , but the Kings wore fine mail as well and had their swords drawn in their hands .
Tirian bowed courteously and was about to speak when the youngest of the Queens laughed .
He stared hard at her face , and then gasped with amazement , for he knew her .
It was Jill : but not Jill as he had last seen her with her face all dirt and tears and an old drill dress half slipping off one shoulder .
Now she looked cool and fresh , as fresh as if she had just come from bathing .
And at first he thought she looked older , but then did n't , and he could never make up his mind on that point .
And then he saw that the youngest of the Kings was Eustace : but he also was changed as Jill was changed .
Tirian suddenly felt awkward about coming among these people with the blood and dust and sweat of a battle still on him .
Next moment he realised that he was not in that state at all .
He was fresh and cool and clean , and dressed in such clothes as he would have worn for a great feast at Cair Paravel .
( But in Narnia your good clothes were never your uncomfortable ones .
They knew how to make things that felt beautiful as well as looking beautiful in Narnia : and there was no such thing as starch or flannel or elastic to be found from one end of the country to the other . )
" Sire , " said Jill , coming forward and making a beautiful curtsey , " let me make you known to Peter the High King over all Kings in Narnia . "
Tirian had no need to ask which was the High King , for he remembered his face ( though here it was far nobler ) from his dream .
He stepped forward , sank on one knee and kissed Peter 's hand .
" High King , " he said .
" You are welcome to me . "
And the High King raised him and kissed him on both cheeks as a High King should .
Then he led him to the eldest of the Queens -- but even she was not old , and there were no grey hairs on her head and no wrinkles on her cheek -- and said , " Sir , this is that Lady Polly who came into Narnia on the First Day , when Aslan made the trees grow and the Beasts talk . "
He brought him next to a man whose golden beard flowed over his breast and whose face was full of wisdom .
" And this is my brother , king Edmund : and this my sister , the Queen Lucy . "
" Sir , " said Tirian , when he had greeted all these .
" If I have read the chronicles aright , there should be another .
Has not your Majesty two sisters ?
Where is Queen Susan ? "
" My sister Susan , " answered Peter shortly and gravely , " is no longer a friend of Narnia . "
" Yes , " said Eustace , " and whenever you 've tried to get her to come and talk about Narnia or do anything about Narnia , she says ' What wonderful memories you have !
Fancy your still thinking about all those funny games we used to play when we were children .
' "
" Oh Susan ! " said Jill , " she 's interested in nothing now - a-days except nylons and lipstick and invitations .
She always was a jolly sight too keen on being grown - up . "
" Grown - up , indeed , " said the Lady Polly .
" I wish she _would_ grow up .
She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now , and she 'll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age .
Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one 's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can . "
" Well , do n't let 's talk about that now , " said Peter .
" Look !
Here are lovely fruit trees .
Let us taste them . "
And then , for the first time , Tirian looked about him and realised how very queer this adventure was .
