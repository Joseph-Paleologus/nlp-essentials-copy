The two Calormene soldiers at the head of the column , seeing what they took for a Tarkaan or great lord with two armed pages , came to a halt and raised their spears in salute .
" O My Master , " said one of them , " We lead these manikins to Calormen to work in the mines of the Tisroc , may - he - live - forever . "
" By the great god Tash , they are very obedient , " said Tirian .
Then suddenly he turned to the Dwarfs themselves .
About one in six of them carried a torch and by that flickering light he could see their bearded faces all looking at him with grim and dogged expressions .
" Has the Tisroc fought a great battle , Dwarfs , and conquered your land , " he asked , " that thus you go patiently to die in the salt pits of Pugrahan ? "
The two soldiers glared at him in surprise but the Dwarfs all answered , " Aslan 's orders , Aslan 's orders .
He 's sold us .
What can we do against _him_ ? "
" Tisroc indeed ! " added one and spat .
" I 'd like to see him try it ! "
" Silence , dog ! " said the chief soldier .
" Look ! " said Tirian , pulling Puzzle forward into the light .
" It has all been a lie .
Aslan has not come to Narnia at all .
You have been cheated by the Ape .
This is the thing he brought out of the stable to show you .
Look at it . "
What the Dwarfs saw , now that they could see it close , was certainly enough to make them wonder how they had ever been taken in .
The lionskin had got pretty untidy already during Puzzle 's long imprisonment in the stable and it had been knocked crooked during his journey through the dark wood .
Most of it was in a big lump on one shoulder .
The head , besides being pushed sidewise , had somehow got very far back so that anyone could now see his silly , gentle , donkey face gazing out of it .
Some grass stuck out of one corner of his mouth , for he 'd been doing a little quiet nibbling as they brought him along .
And he was muttering , " It was n't my fault , I 'm not clever .
I never said I _was_ . "
For one second all the Dwarfs were staring at Puzzle with wide open mouths and then one the soldiers said sharply , " Are you mad , My Master !
What are you doing to the slaves ? " and the other said , " And who are you ? "
Neither of their spears were at the salute now -- both were down and ready for action .
" Give the password , " said the chief soldier .
" This is my password , " said the King as he drew his sword .
" _The light is dawning , the lie broken_ .
Now guard thee , miscreant , for I am Tirian of Narnia . "
He flew upon the chief soldier like lightning , Eustace , who had drawn his sword when he saw the King draw his , rushed at the other one : his face was deadly pale , but I would n't blame him for that .
And he had the luck that beginners sometimes do have .
He forgot all that Tirian had tried to teach him that afternoon , slashed wildly ( indeed I 'm not sure his eyes were n't shut ) and suddenly found , to his own great surprise , that the Calormene lay dead at his feet .
And though that was a great relief , it was , at the moment , rather frightening .
The King 's fight lasted a second or two longer : then he too had killed his man and shouted to Eustace , " ' Ware the other two . "
But the Dwarfs had settled the two remaining Calormenes .
There was no enemy left .
" Well struck , Eustace ! " cried Tirian , clapping him on the back .
" Now , Dwarfs , you are free .
Tomorrow I will lead you to free all Narnia .
Three cheers for Aslan ! "
But the result which followed was simply wretched .
There was a feeble attempt from a few Dwarfs ( about five ) which died away all at once : from several others there were sulky growls .
Many said nothing at all .
" Do n't they understand ? " said Jill impatiently .
" What 's wrong with all you Dwarfs ?
Do n't you hear what the King says ?
It 's all over .
The Ape is n't going to rule Narnia any longer .
Everyone can go back to ordinary life .
You can have fun again .
Are n't you glad ? "
After a pause of nearly a minute a not - very - nice looking Dwarf with hair and beard as black as soot said :
" And who might you be , Missie ? "
" I 'm Jill , " she said .
" The same Jill who rescued King Rilian from the enchantment -- and this is Eustace who did it too -- and we 've come back from another world after hundreds of years .
Aslan sent us . "
The Dwarfs all looked at one another with grins ; sneering grins , not merry ones .
" Well , " said the Black Dwarf ( whose name was Griffle ) , " I do n't know how all you chaps feel , but I feel I 've heard as much about Aslan as I want to for the rest of my life . "
" That 's right , that 's right , " growled the other Dwarfs .
" It 's all a trick , all a blooming trick . "
" What do you mean ? " said Tirian .
He had not been pale when he was fighting but he was pale now .
He had thought this was going to be a beautiful moment , but it was turning out more like a bad dream .
" You must think we 're blooming soft in the head , that you must , " said Griffle .
" We 've been taken in once and now you expect us to be taken in again the next minute .
We 've no more use for stories about Aslan , see !
Look at him !
An old moke with long ears ! "
" By heaven , you make me mad , " said Tirian .
" Which of us said _that_ was Aslan ?
That is the Ape 's imitation of the real Aslan .
Ca n't you understand ? "
" And you 've got a better imitation , I suppose ! " said Griffle .
" No thanks .
We 've been fooled once and we 're not going to be fooled again . "
" I have not , " said Tirian angrily , " I serve the real Aslan . "
" Where 's he ?
Who 's he ?
Show him to us ! " said several Dwarfs .
" Do you think I keep him in my wallet , fools ? " said Tirian .
" Who am I that I could make Aslan appear at my bidding ?
He 's not a tame lion . "
The moment those words were out of his mouth he realised that he had made a false move .
The Dwarfs at once began repeating " not a tame lion , not a tame lion , " in a jeering singsong .
" That 's what the other lot kept on telling us , " said one .
" Do you mean you do n't believe in the real Aslan ? " said Jill .
" But I 've seen him .
And he has sent us two here out of a different world . "
" Ah , " said Griffle with a broad smile .
" So _you_ say .
They 've taught you your stuff all right .
Saying your lessons , ai n't you ? "
" Churl , " cried Tirian , " will you give a lady a lie to her very face ? "
" You keep a civil tongue in your head , Mister , " replied the Dwarf .
" I do n't think we want any more kings -- if you _are_ Tirian , which you do n't look like him -- no more than we want any Aslans .
We 're going to look after ourselves from now on and touch our caps to nobody .
See ? "
" That 's right , " said the other Dwarfs .
" We 're on our own now .
No more Aslan , no more kings , no more silly stories about other worlds .
The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs . "
And they began to fall into their places and to get ready for marching back to wherever they had come from .
" Little beasts ! " said Eustace .
" Are n't you even going to say _thank you_ for being saved from the salt - mines ? "
" Oh , we know all about that , " said Griffle over his shoulder .
" You wanted to make use of us , that 's why you rescued us .
You 're playing some game of your own .
Come on you chaps . "
And the Dwarfs struck up the queer little marching song which goes with the drumbeat , and off they tramped into the darkness .
Tirian and his friends stared after them .
Then he said the single word " Come , " and they continued their journey .
They were a silent party .
Puzzle felt himself to be still in disgrace , and also he did n't really quite understand what had happened .
Jill , besides being disgusted with the Dwarfs , was very impressed with Eustace 's victory over the Calormene and felt almost shy .
As for Eustace , his heart was still beating rather quickly .
Tirian and Jewel walked sadly together in the rear .
The King had his arm on the Unicorn 's shoulder and sometimes the Unicorn nuzzled the King 's cheek with his soft nose .
They did not try to comfort one another with words .
It was n't very easy to think of anything to say that would be comforting .
Tirian had never dreamed that one of the results of an Ape 's setting up a false Aslan would be to stop people from believing in the real one .
He had felt quite sure that the Dwarfs would rally to his side the moment he showed them how they had been deceived .
And then next night he would have led them to Stable Hill and shown Puzzle to all the creatures and everyone would have turned against the Ape and , perhaps after a scuffle with the Calormenes , the whole thing would have been over .
But now , it seemed , he could count on nothing .
How many other Narnians might turn the same way as the Dwarfs ?
" Somebody 's coming after us , I think , " said Puzzle suddenly .
They stopped and listened .
Sure enough , there was a thump - thump of small feet behind them .
" Who goes there ! " shouted the King .
" Only me , Sire , " came a voice .
" Me , Poggin the Dwarf .
I 've only just managed to get away from the others .
I 'm on your side , Sire : and on Aslan 's .
If you can put a Dwarfish sword in my fist , I 'd gladly strike a blow on the right side before all 's done . "
Everyone crowded round him and welcomed him and praised him and slapped him on the back .
Of course one single Dwarf could not make a very great difference , but it was somehow very cheering to have even one .
The whole party brightened up .
But Jill and Eustace did n't stay bright for very long , for they were now yawning their heads off and too tired to think about anything but bed .
It was at the coldest hour of the night , just before dawn , that they got back to the Tower .
If there had been a meal ready for them they would have been glad enough to eat , but the bother and delay of getting one was not to be thought of .
They drank from a stream , splashed their faces with water , and tumbled into their bunks , except for Puzzle and Jewel who said they 'd be more comfortable outside .
This perhaps was just as well , for a Unicorn and a fat , full - grown donkey indoors always make a room feel rather crowded .
Narnian Dwarfs , though less than four feet high , are for their size about the toughest and strongest creatures there are , so that Poggin , in spite of a heavy day and a late night , woke fully refreshed before any of the others .
He at once took Jill 's bow , went out and shot a couple of wood pigeons .
Then he sat plucking them on the door - step and chatting to Jewel and Puzzle .
Puzzle looked and felt a good deal better this morning .
Jewel , being a Unicorn and therefore one of the noblest and most delicate of beasts , had been very kind to him , talking to him about things of the sort they could both understand like grass and sugar and the care of one 's hoofs .
When Jill and Eustace came out of the Tower yawning and rubbing their eyes at almost half past ten , the Dwarf showed them where they could gather plenty of a Narnian weed called Wild Fresney , which looks rather like our wood sorel but tastes a good deal nicer when cooked .
( It needs a little butter and pepper to make it perfect , but they had n't these . )
So with one thing and another , they had the makings of a capital stew for their breakfast or dinner , whichever you choose to call it .
Tirian went a little further off into the wood with an axe and brought back some branches for fuel .
While the meal was cooking -- which seemed a very long time , especially as it smelled nicer and nicer the nearer it came to being done -- the King found a complete Dwarfish outfit for Poggin : mail - shirt , helmet , shield , sword , belt , and dagger .
Then he inspected Eustace 's sword and found that Eustace had put it back in the sheath all messy from killing the Calormene .
He was scolded for that and made to clean and polish it .
All this while Jill went to and fro , sometimes stirring the pot and sometimes looking out enviously at the Donkey and the Unicorn who were contentedly grazing .
How many times that morning she wished she could eat grass !
But when the meal came everyone felt it had been worth waiting for , and there were second helpings all round .
When everyone had eaten as much as he could , the three humans and the Dwarf came and sat on the doorstep , the four - footed ones lay down facing them , the Dwarf ( with permission both from Jill and from Tirian ) lit his pipe , and the King said :
" Now , friend Poggin , you have more news of the enemy , most likely , than we .
Tell us all you know .
And first , what tale do they tell of my escape ? "
" As cunning a tale , Sire , as ever was devised , " said Poggin .
" It was the Cat , Ginger , who told it , and most likely made it up too .
This Ginger , Sire -- oh , he 's a slyboots if ever a cat was -- said he was walking past the tree to which those villains bound your Majesty .
And he said ( saving your reverence ) that you were howling and swearing and cursing Aslan : ' language I would n't like to repeat ' were the words he used , looking ever so prim and proper -- you know the way a Cat can when it pleases .
And then , says Ginger , Aslan himself suddenly appeared in a flash of lightning and swallowed your Majesty up at one mouthful .
All the Beasts trembled at this story and some fainted right away .
And of course the Ape followed it up .
There , he says , see what Aslan does to those who do n't respect him .
Let that be a warning to you all .
And the poor creatures wailed and whined and said , it will , it will .
So that in the upshot your Majesty 's escape has not set them thinking whether you still have loyal friends to aid you , but only made them more afraid and more obedient to the Ape . "
" What devilish policy ! " said Tirian .
" This Ginger , then , is close in the Ape 's counsels . "
" It 's more a question by now , Sire , if the Ape is in _his_ counsels , " replied the Dwarf .
" The Ape has taken to drinking , you see .
My belief is that the plot is now mostly carried on by Ginger or Rishda -- that 's the Calormene captain .
And I think some words that Ginger has scattered among the Dwarfs are chiefly to blame for the scurvy return they made you .
And I 'll tell you why .
One of those dreadful midnight meetings had just broken up the night before last and I 'd gone a bit of the way home when I found I 'd left my pipe behind .
It was a real good ' un , an old favourite , so I went back to look for it .
But before I got to the place where I 'd been sitting ( it was black as pitch there ) , I heard a cat 's voice say _Mew_ and a Calormene voice say ' here ... speak softly , ' so I just stood as still as if I were frozen .
And these two were Ginger and Rishda Tarkaan as they call him .
' Noble Tarkaan , ' said the Cat in that silky voice of his .
' I just wanted to know exactly what we both meant to - day about Aslan meaning _no more_ than Tash .
' ' Doubtless , most sagacious of cats , ' says the other , ' you have perceived my meaning .
' ' You mean , ' says Ginger , ' that there 's no such person as either .
' ' All who are enlightened know that , ' said the Tarkaan .
' Then we can understand one another , ' purrs the Cat .
' Do you , like me , grow a little weary of the Ape ?
' ' A stupid , greedy brute , ' says the other , ' but we must use him for the present .
Thou and I must provide for all things in secret and make the Ape do our will .
' ' And it would be better , would n't it , ' said Ginger , ' to let some of the more enlightened Narnians into our counsels : one by one , as we find them apt .
For the Beasts who really believe in Aslan may turn at any moment : and will , if the Ape 's folly betrays his secret .
But those who care neither for Tash nor Aslan but have only an eye to their own profit , and such reward as the Tisroc may give them when Narnia is a Calormene province , will be firm .
' ' Excellent Cat , ' said the Captain .
' But choose which ones carefully .
' "
While the Dwarf had been speaking the day seemed to have changed .
It had been sunny when they sat down .
Now Puzzle shivered .
Jewel shifted his head uneasily .
Jill looked up .
" It 's clouding over , " she said .
" And it 's so cold , " said Puzzle .
" Cold enough , by the Lion ! " said Tirian , blowing on his hands .
" And faugh !
What foul smell is this ? "
" Phew ! " gasped Eustace .
" It 's like something dead .
Is there a dead bird somewhere about ?
And why did n't we notice it before ? "
With a great upheaval Jewel scrambled to his feet and pointed with his horn .
" Look ! " he cried .
" Look at it !
Look , look ! "
Then all six of them saw ; and over all their faces there came an expression of uttermost dismay .
